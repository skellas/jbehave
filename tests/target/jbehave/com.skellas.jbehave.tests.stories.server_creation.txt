Narrative:
In order to prove that Servers can be created
As a tester
I want to create multiple servers then call their getters
Scenario: Server should return the identifier used in the constructor
Examples:
Given a server is created with identifier <identifier> and status <status>
Then the server responds with <knownIdentifier>

|identifier|status|knownIdentifier|
|AAA|AVAILABLE|AAA|
|BBB|DOWN|BBB|

Example: {identifier=AAA, status=AVAILABLE, knownIdentifier=AAA}
Given a server is created with identifier AAA and status AVAILABLE
Then the server responds with AAA

Example: {identifier=BBB, status=DOWN, knownIdentifier=BBB}
Given a server is created with identifier BBB and status DOWN
Then the server responds with BBB


Scenario: Server should return the status used in the constructor
Examples:
Given a server is created with identifier <identifier> and status <status>
Then the server responds with <knownStatus>

|identifier|status|knownStatus|
|AAA|AVAILABLE|AVAILABLE|
|BBB|DOWN|DOWN|

Example: {identifier=AAA, status=AVAILABLE, knownStatus=AVAILABLE}
Given a server is created with identifier AAA and status AVAILABLE
Then the server responds with AVAILABLE

Example: {identifier=BBB, status=DOWN, knownStatus=DOWN}
Given a server is created with identifier BBB and status DOWN
Then the server responds with DOWN
